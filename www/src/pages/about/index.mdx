**Hi, I'm Lennart ðŸ‘‹**<br /><br />
I'm a designer turned software engineer from Darmstadt, Germany. I currently work at [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) on the open source software (OSS).
I'm passionate about working on open source projects & building thriving communities around them.<br />
My [OSS code](https://github.com/LekoArts) has been used by thousands of people & I regularly share educational content in the form of [posts](/writing), [presentations](/appearances), and [videos](/appearances).

## Hobbies

If I'm not coding I like to spend my time with playing tennis & hiking in the mountains. I then often take my camera with me to take [landscape photos](/art/photography) and also particularly enjoy editing the photos at the computer afterwards. I also enjoy creating other forms of [art](/art) such as 3D art or UI design. Lastly, my kindle is always filled with fantasy & sci-fi books ðŸ“š.
